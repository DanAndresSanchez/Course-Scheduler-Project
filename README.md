Specification
There is a need to develop a program that will help with automating parts of the scheduling
process. Specifically, the program should do the following:
• Maintain a database of CS courses
• Create a spreadsheet that allows selecting and placing courses into specific timeslots of
specific classrooms in a given spreadsheet
• Converts intermediate schedule representation (i.e., course placement into specific
timeslots and classrooms) into format required by the Scheduling department
• Verify correctness of the created scheduled by checking for time/room conflicts, faculty
load, faculty schedule (e.g., no teaching two classes at the same time), etc.
• Generate scheduling reports that displays weekly schedule for each faculty with their
corresponding loads, BA in C&I schedule, BS in CS schedule, MS in CS schedule, MS in DA
schedule, etc.
The program will have to work with MS Excel.
