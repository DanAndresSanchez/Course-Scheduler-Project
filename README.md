# Course Scheduler
Software Engineering Project - Spring 2020 @ Rowan University
### Sponsor: Dr. Vasil Hnatyshin - Computer Science Department Head
### Mentor: Professor Jack Myers - Computer Science Department Instructor

#### Specifications
There is a need to develop a program that will help with automating parts of the scheduling
process. Specifically, the program should do the following:
- Maintain a database of CS courses
- Create a spreadsheet that allows selecting and placing courses into specific timeslots of specific classrooms in a given spreadsheet
- Converts intermediate schedule representation (i.e., course placement into specific timeslots and classrooms) into format required by the Scheduling department
- Verify correctness of the created scheduled by checking for time/room conflicts, faculty load, faculty schedule (e.g., no teaching two classes at the same time), etc.
- Generate scheduling reports that displays weekly schedule for each faculty with their corresponding loads, BA in C&I schedule, BS in CS schedule, MS in CS schedule, MS in DA schedule, etc.
- The program will have to work with MS Excel.
